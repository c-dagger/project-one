    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article id="aboutme">
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
          Yes I am a Dugger. No I am not related to the family on the TLC show
          "19 Kids and Counting". Although, I am the oldest of 5 and my youngest
          sibling is 18 years my junior. We're not your average family, but we
          definitely do not disappoint!
        </p>
        <h3>Student</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Graduate student in the Information Technology and Management
          Program at Illinois Institute of Technology. Previously graduated with
          a Bachelor of Business Management and Marketing at University of
          Wisconsin - Parkside.

        <h3>Fun</h3>
          <h4>Camping</h4>
          <p>
            My family and I have gone camping since I was a little girl. Over
            the years, we have evolved from borrowed tents, to our own tents, to
            a pop-up trailer, to a stationary trailer, to what we have now - an
            RV trailer. My parents are avid campers so I have always cherished
            the idea of family time outdoors, with limited cell phone
            connection. There is no better feeling than listening to 80s rock,
            making smores in your favorite hoodie, going on a late night golf
            cart ride by the beach, and cracking jokes with your family by the
            campfire.
          </p>
          <h4>Travelling</h4>
          <p>
            Travelling is one of the greatest joys of my life. I try to go to at
            least one destination vacation a year.  I love travelling because it
            is a reality check that bursts our every day bubble. It is a notion
            that there  is so much more to life than just our immediate
            surroundings, our every day stressors. It is hope and courage  that
            you can always change your life and move in a new direction,
            literally. Travelling teaches us to be humble and  grateful for what
            we have and to remind us that life is too short to stress on the
            little things.
