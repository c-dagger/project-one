      <article id="aboutme">
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
          Yes I am a Dugger. No I am not related to the family on the TLC show
          "19 Kids and Counting". Although, I am the oldest of 5 and my youngest
          sibling is 18 years my junior. We're not your average family, but we
          definitely do not disappoint!
        </p>
        <h3>Student</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Graduate student in the Information Technology and Management
          Program at Illinois Institute of Technology. Previously graduated with
          a Bachelor of Business Management and Marketing at University of
          Wisconsin - Parkside.
