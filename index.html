          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>
            Yes I am a Dugger. No I am not related to the family on the TLC show "19 Kids and
            Counting". Although, I am the oldest of 5 and my youngest sibling is 18
            years my junior. We're not your average family, but we definitely do not
            disappoint!
